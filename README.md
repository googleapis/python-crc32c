This package wraps the [`google/crc32c`](https://github.com/google/crc32c)
hardware-based implementation of the CRC32C hashing algorithm. Multiple wheels
are distributed as well as source. If a wheel is not published for the python
version and platform you are using, you will need to compile crc32c using a
C toolchain.

# Currently Published Wheels

Wheels are currently published for CPython 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13
for multiple architectures. PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 are also supported for Linux.
For information on building your own wheels please view [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).


## Linux

Wheels are published for the following platforms / architectures:

- `manylinux2010` platform, `x86_64` and `1686` architectures
- `manylinux2014` platform, `aarch64` architecture

### Unsupported Platforms

- `manylinux1` platform, `x86_64` architecture support has ended.
See https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/994.

## Mac OS
